## Getting Started
Please follow these instructions to get your copy of the project and get it running on your local machine so you can view or debug before use.

### Prerequisites
If you haven't already downloaded a code editor please install one to run the project. The following is my editor of choice:

- VSCode which can download here: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You will also need Node.js JavaScript runtime. Use the following link for instructions on install via download or package manager:

- Node.js download and instructions here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/package-manager)

### Installation
Once you have your code editor up and running you can follow the steps below to clone the repo and run the project for yourself!

1 - Clone the repo with the following shell command:


`$ git clone https://github.com/CherryElla/api-for-social-network.git`

2 - Open or `cd` into the project folder with your VSCode or editor of choice and in the integrated terminal in the root directory install the dependencies using the following command:

`$ npm install`

3 -  Double check nodemon has installed in the dev dependencies, and if not, you can use the following command to do so:

`$ npm install --save-dev nodemon`

### Running
Now that you have your environment set up, you can use the following command to start the server:

`$ npm run dev`

Next, using your API testing platform of choice (I have linked below two popular platforms) go ahead and test your endpoints!
